### Project Description
basically its a fake news generator which is also fake but if you investigate a little more you will find the truthness about the news 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
we show the true colors of people propogating fake news about them . Most of the news available in online are fake what if we provide fake news that will show the truth . thaaliyola is a fake website which is actually useless but it shows what people truly are hence makes it a little bit usefull .
